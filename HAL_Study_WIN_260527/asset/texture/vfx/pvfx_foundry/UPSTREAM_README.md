# PVFX Foundry

Nineteen original 96×96 pixel-art visual effects for combat, elemental,
defensive, support, status, portal, and environmental gameplay. Every effect
is a transparent animation authored and deterministically rendered with Pixel
VFX Studio.

You do not need Pixel VFX Studio to use this pack.

## What is included

- 19 effects at 20 FPS, including three seamless loops.
- 38 transparent PNG sprite sheets: one fixed grid and one trimmed packed sheet
  per effect.
- Exact JSON metadata for frame order, timing, pivots, markers, placements, and
  canonical per-frame hashes.
- A pack index, checksums, provenance, and import documentation.

The visual download contains sprite sheets only. It does not include animation
files, frame sequences, project source, engine plugins, or software binaries.

## Fastest import

Open an effect's `grid/sprite-sheet.png` and slice it into 96×96 cells using
five columns. Read frames left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and stop at the frame
count in `pack.json` or the adjacent manifest. Every current frame lasts 50 ms.

For smaller textures and exact trimmed pivots, use the corresponding `packed`
sheet and follow its manifest placements.

See `IMPORTING.md` for formulas and `FORMAT.md` for the stable pack contract.
